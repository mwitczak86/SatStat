# SatStat - console pinger.
A C# console application that pings multiple hosts in a network to check their status. Continous ping option is included. The application allows users to configure the list of hosts to be pinged using a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, which can be written and read by the application. This tool can be useful for monitoring the availability of hosts in a network and for identifying potential connectivity issues.
